#Change log for GridSim Toolkit

Changes from 5.0 to 5.2
- fix a few bugs
- Add a new package (i.e. gridsim.fta) for simulating resource failures, and provides:
	* A failure generator based on the Failure Trace Archive (FTA) format (http://fta.inria.fr).
	* A new allocation policy for scheduling of bag of tasks on cluster systems in the
	  presence of resource failures.
- Includes an implementation of the DAS-2 parallel jobs workload for modelling
multi-cluster workloads.

=======================================================================
Changes from 4.2 to 5.0
- Improvements to make GridSim more compatible with Java 5 and 6
- Changes in SimJava to enable a simulation to be paused and resumed.
- Add a new package (i.e. gridsim.parallel) that provides:
	* A graphical user interface for debugging resource allocation policies
	* several allocation policies for scheduling parallel jobs on clusters and
	and supercomputers. The policies include aggressive backfilling, conservative
	backfilling, advance reservation with conservative backfilling, selective
	backfilling and agressive backfilling with multiple resource partitions.
	* A workload model by Lublin and Feitelson for generating jobs for grid resources.
	* A data structure to facilitate the scheduling of jobs and advance reservations.
	* Logging features using Java logging API.  

=======================================================================
Changes from 4.0 to 4.1
- add a new functionality that supports resource failures during runtime.
  This work was done in collaboration with Agustin Caminero from
  Universidad de Castilla La Mancha (UCLM), Spain.
- fix few bugs in the code and examples.

=======================================================================
Changes from 3.3 to 4.0
- add two major new features: auction model and data grid
- add a new packet scheduler for the network package
- add a network reader to read a network topology from a file and automatically
creates and link routers
- modify some of the network classes to incorporate this new packet scheduler
- fix few bugs

=======================================================================
Changes from 3.2 to 3.3
No new additions, it mainly about bug fixes:
- for a Regional GIS feature (discovered by Agustin Caminero).
Classes affected: AbstractGIS and RegionalGIS

- inside GridSim class (discovered by Sai Rahul Reddy) for the below methods:
  * getResourceCharacteristics()
  * getResourceDynamicInfo()
It will cause an exception because waiting for the next incoming event, which
might not the correct tag. Hence, use filtering instead.

- Example 4, 5, and 6 (discovered by Sai Rahul Reddy) should not have
gridlet.setResourceParameter( resourceID[id], resourceCost[id] );
This is because inside the gridresource already call this method.
It will create a new Resource object inside the gridlet.

- a networked GridSim entity can not send a null data to itself (discovered
by Uros Cibej).

- a Gridlet must have a ToS for Differentiated network.

- for advanced reservation feature, queryBusyTime() and queryFreeTime()
needs to know a time zone from user (discovered by Jakub Milkiewicz).


=======================================================================
Changes from 3.1 to 3.2
- incorporates multiple regional GridInformationService (GIS) entities
  connected in a network topology. With this functionality, a resource
  registers to its regional GIS entity. In addition, a regional GIS entity
  can communicate/query to other GIS entities about their local resources.
  In summary, this functionality allows a Virtual Organization (VO) scenario.

- incorporates a functionality to select/filter an event from the incoming
  entity's queue based on some constraints.

- bug fixes in sending and receiving acknowledgement in GridSim and
  AdvanceReservation class.

=======================================================================
Changes from 3.0 to 3.1
- incorporates a network extension into GridSim.
  Now, resources and other entities can be linked in a network topology.
  Network elements like routers and links can be extended for more
  functionality. The schedulers being used can be modified to support
  other scheduling paradigms like EDF, Delay Jitter regulator etc.
  In addition, data sent over the network is automatically packetised depending
  on the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of a link.

  This work was done in collaboration with Gokul Poduval and Chen-Khong Tham
  from Computer Communication Networks (CCN) Lab,
  National University of Singapore (NUS).

- incorporates a background traffic functionality based on a probabilistic
  distribution. This is useful for simulating over a public network
  where the network is congested.

- incorporates a functionality that reads workload traces taken from
  supercomputers for simulating a realistic grid environment.

- adds ant build file to compile GridSim source files.

=======================================================================
Changes from 2.2 to 3.0
- adds new functionalities, especially regarding to advanced reservation
  mechanisms. GridSim has the framework / infrastructure to handle
  advanced reservation functionalities, such as:
  * create a new reservation
  * commit a reservation
  * cancel an existing reservation
  * modify an existing reservation
  * query the status of an existing reservation

- make GridResource and GridInformationService class to be more extensible.
- modify the overall GridSim architecture to incorporate advanced reservation
  functionalities. In addition, this new architecture is more extensible and
  easier to create your own GridResource and/or GridInformationService entity.
- add different ways to initialize GridSim, see GridSim.init() methods for
  more details.
- fix minor bugs and encoding problem on example source code.

=======================================================================
Changes from 2.1 to 2.2
- adds new functionalities regarding to Job or Gridlet migration.
  New methods in GridSim class are
  * gridletCancel(): cancels a Gridlet executed in a GridResource
  * gridletMove(): moves a Gridlet to a different GridResource
  * gridletPause(): pauses an executed Gridlet
  * gridletResume(): resumes a previously paused Gridlet
  * gridletStatus(): queries the status of a Gridlet

- each Job or Gridlet has its own activity log or history.
  Therefore, you can view where this Gridlet being assigned to and
  how long the execution takes.

- decouples both Time-Shared and Space-Shared allocation policy
  from inside GridResource class into separate classes. This way,
  new allocation policy can be made and integrated into the GridSim
  Toolkit easily without the need to recompile and reconstruct
  the whole package.

- rewritten Time-Shared and Space-Shared allocation policy to
  incorporate Gridlet migration and new functionalities.

- uses the new version of SimJava, i.e. version 2 instead of 1.2
- fix minor bugs


=======================================================================
Changes from 2.0 to 2.1
- clean up GridSim and GridBroker source code.
- add more documentation to GridSim, GridBroker and VisualModeler source code.
- use Java's code convention to GridSim and GridBroker. Hence, they are
  plenty of deprecated methods.
- fix minor bugs.
- add examples of how to use GridSim and GridBroker.
- grouped together the classes into jar file.
- optimize VisualModeler code especially regarding to generate Java and XML
  file.


=======================================================================
Changes from 1.1 to 2.0
- separate GridSim and GridBroker into separate package and directory.
- add VisualModeler component.
