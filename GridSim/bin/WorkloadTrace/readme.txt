This directory contains many GridSim examples.
Here are the summary of what each example does:

example01: 
	shows how to use the GridSim workload trace functionality.
	This example shows each Workload entity sends Gridlets to
	a particular grid resource.
	No other GridSim user entities are created.

example02: 
	shows how to use the GridSim workload trace functionality.
  	This example creates three entities: User, Workload and GridResource 
  	WITHOUT a network topology. The User and Workload entity sends Gridlets 
  	to a particular GridResource entity. 

example03: 
	shows how to use the GridSim workload trace functionality.
  	This example creates three entities: NetUser, Workload and GridResource 
  	WITH a network topology. The NetUser and Workload entity sends Gridlets 
  	to a particular GridResource entity.
