Q: Where can I find gridbroker, visual modeler, ... ?

A: Gridbroker and Visual Modeler are no longer supported. 

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: I would like to do some experiments for my research work on grid computing
   using the simulator package that you have. Using the simulator,
   can I simulate a grid environment with service providers requestors,
   administrators, etc. on a PC environment? Please pass on some resources,
   links, and white papers and links where from I should download.

A: The best way to learn GridSim is by downloading it from the link below:
   http://www.gridbus.org/gridsim/

   Go through the provided examples directory.
   GridSim's website contains links to papers that have used GridSim.

   As long as you have JDK version 1.5 onwards, you can run GridSim
   on a PC. However, if you run a large simulation, you'd probably need
   bigger RAM and CPU.

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: How do you compile and run GridSim application?

A: For example, if you want to run Example1

   In Unix/Linux:
   * go to the examples directory, i.e.
     at command prompt type: cd $GRIDSIM/examples
   * to compile type: 
   		javac -cp $GRIDSIM/jars/gridsim.jar:. gridsim/example01/Example1.java
   * to run type: 
   		java -cp $GRIDSIM/jars/gridsim.jar:. gridsim.example01.Example1

   In Windows:
   * go to the examples directory, i.e.
     at command prompt type: cd %GRIDSIM%\examples
   * to compile type:  javac -cp %GRIDSIM%\jars\gridsim.jar;. gridsim\example01\Example1.java
   * to run type: java -cp %GRIDSIM%\jars\gridsim.jar;. gridsim.example01.Example1

   The main difference is the use of ":" for Unix/Linux, and ";" for Windows
   NOTE: $GRIDSIM or %GRIDSIM% is the location of the GridSim Toolkit package.
         Also, gridsim.jar contains SimJava v2.0 classes. Hence,
         you do not need to install SimJava libraries.

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: When I run GridSim application, I have the following error message:
        Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Example1

A: You need the classpath to refer to the directory where Example1.java
   located. For Example, to run in Windows:
        java -classpath gridsim.jar;. gridsim.example01.Example1

   where gridsim.example01.Example1 is the classname you want to execute

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: My GridSim application runs perfectly, however, after the end of simulation
   it just hang without exiting properly.

A: The problem may be caused by not closing GridSim entities, such as
   GridStatistics, I/O ports, etc. Each class that extends GridSim with
   a networked I/O ports must use terminate the I/O entities by using
   terminateIOEntities() before exiting body() method.

   Another cause for this problem is the number of Grid user entities.
   Before the start of a GridSim application, you need to intialize the GridSim
   package using GridSim.init(). The method requires to have the number of
   Grid user entities. If the number is different from the actual Grid user
   entities, your GridSim application will hang or can't exit properly.

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: I am creating a network topology using GridSim. When I run the experiment,
I have the following exception message:

java.lang.NullPointerException
   at gridsim.net.RIPRouter.getScheduler(RIPRouter.java:451)
   at gridsim.net.RIPRouter.getScheduler(RIPRouter.java:401)
   at gridsim.net.RIPRouter.processNetPacket(RIPRouter.java:302)
   at gridsim.net.RIPRouter.processEvent(RIPRouter.java:270)
   at gridsim.net.Router.body(Router.java:267)
   at eduni.simjava.Sim_entity.run(Sim_entity.java:603)

A: Network exception message is generally caused by 2 things:
- If you created a new router or link entity, it hasn't been registered to
GridInformationService class; OR

- GridSim needs few seconds for all network entities to be registered and
for the network entity to fill in its routing table dynamically.
Currently, GridSim uses a flooding approach for locating the neighbour
routers. Hence, these routers need time to receive all the replies.
I think this could be the main cause of the exception message.

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: When running GridSim Example 4, 5 and 6 I got an infinite loop
   saying: "Waiting to get list of resources".

A: In GridSim 2.1, GridSim.getGridResourceList() uses a message event
   to tell GIS (GridInformationService) entity to send the GridResource
   list. This causes a significant delay and a bit redundant.

   In GridSim 2.2, GridSim.getGridResourceList() directly uses a
   method call to GIS entity rather than a message passing.
   This makes the operation a lot faster. However, during the early stage
   of simulation, a GridResource might be slow in registering its service
   to GIS. Hence, the GridResource list is always empty and causing
   an infinite loop.

   To solve this problem, inside the while() loop, put the following
   code:
            // need to pause for a while to wait GridResources finish
            // registering to GIS
            super.gridSimHold(1.0);    // hold by 1 second

   So, you wait 1 second later to get GridResource list.

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: When I tried to run GridSim Example4, I have the following error message:
    java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError
        at Example4.body(Example4.java:70)
        at eduni.simjava.Sim_entity.run(Sim_entity.java:603)

A: I am not sure what is the exact problem. However, this is mainly
   caused by older release of SimJava. GridSim Toolkit 2.2 and above now use
   SimJava2. Simply recompile the Example4.java will solve this
   problem.

   NOTE: This problem is also effected GridSim Example6.

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: When I tried to run GridSim Example1, I have the following error message:
    Exception in thread "main" eduni.simjava.Sim_exception:
    Sim_entity: Entity names can't contain spaces.
        at eduni.simjava.Sim_entity.<init>(Sim_entity.java:154)
        at gridsim.GridSim.<init>(GridSim.java:149)
        at gridsim.GridResource.<init>(GridResource.java:93)
        at Example1.createGridResource(Example1.java:188)
        at Example1.main(Example1.java:57)

A: GridSim Toolkit 2.2 and above now use SimJava2. SimJava2 is more strict about
   a valid entity name compare to previous release. Hence, to fix this
   problem is to remove the unnecessary empty space, i.e.
   "GridResource 0" becomes "GridResource_0"

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: Are there any type of applications that I can simulate with GridSim?

A: GridSim provides the grid simulation environment (with resources and
   users), but you need to write codes specifically for the application you
   want to simulate, e.g. a resource broker Nimrod/G is written to call
   GridSim classes.

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: How do I create Gridlets with compute I/O requirements?

A: Gridlets with compute I/O requirements are simulated through their file
   sizes (input) and output size (output) parameters.
   See Figure 16 of the GridSim paper.

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: I have a question on network simulation in Gridsim.
   In my understanding, entities with networking capability must define
   input and output port. Both ports are "connected" to a simulated network.
   How does Gridsim models network link and its characteristics, especially
   bandwidth, since I couldn't find class that models this network link?
   Does Gridsim also simulate bandwidth-sharing if there are several IOdata
   are sent using the same link?

A: Not supported in the older versions. Currently GridSim uses very
   simple network model.

   Since GridSim 3.1, it has a realistic network model. However,
   advanced network features are not supported.

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: Is GridSim tool kit provides any help in solving problems for dynamic
   resource allocation upon failure?

A: GridSim provides mechanism to reserve, but policy of reservation and
   how to handle failures etc. is up to server's provider and consumers
   to define.

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: How do you model the gridlet execution in time_shared resource?

A: Just creating a Gridlet is sufficient. It runs on both time and space
   shared machines.

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: Does each gridlet can only be processed by only one PE?

A: For older GridSim versions, it runs one PE.
   Since GridSim 3.0, each Gridlet can ask to be run on multiple PEs.
   However, it is up to the scheduler to handle this.
   At the moment, by default, TimeShared and SpaceShared scheduler executes
   an incoming Gridlet to only 1 PE.

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: Is the model for parallel job included inside the GridSim?

A: It is up users to model parallel application job at the higher level
   (develop on top of gridsim).

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: When I run GridSim, I have the following error message:
        Sim_system:Error - past event detected!
        Time: 0.0, event time: -XXXXX.X event type: 1
        Where XXXXX.X is a negative number that varies.

A: It appears like this error comes up for one of the following scenarios:
   - an entity or object waits for a specific event. However, the response
     event type is different.
   - some events are not captured.
   - GridSim runs under multi-threaded environment. Hence, some events might
     be accidentally deleted or being changed by other thread to wait for
     a different response that doesn't exist, etc ...

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: Does GridSim currently support the usage of any wireless network standard
when specifying network topology?

A: No. We have NOT done so much about wireless network support in GridSim.
   But if you are willing, we could explore this with you.

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: Does GridSim support multiple simulations or runs in a single program?

A: No. Currently, GridSim only allows a single experiment to run in a main()
   method. Hence, to calculate a confidence interval, you need to do this
   manually.

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: Does GridSim run in a cluster or a PC?

A: GridSim runs in a PC as a stand-alone program with multiple threads.
   This means if you want to run in a cluster, you just need to request 1 node.

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: I came across three variables: peak load, off-peak load and holiday load.
   I understand from the study I have done that these variables represent
   the load factor. I do not fully get what this means and was hoping that
   you could help me out so I can progress further with my work.

A: These load factors are influencing the total execution time
   of a job in a given resource.
   If you set these loads to zero, means this resource is idle / free.
   If you want to write a resource scheduler, like SpaceShared or TimeShared
   then these load factors are important.

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: for the Gridlet class, what are the units of file size, length, and output?

A: the unit of file size and output is in byte.
   For the Gridlet length, the unit is in MI (Millions Instructions).
   A CPU clock is measured in MIPS (Millions Instructions Per Second) as
   suggested by SPEC.

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: In the previous releases of GridSim you had to use
GridSim class to send messages to other entities. The provided "send" methods
included a parameter to indicate the sender of the request. It is no clear how
to indicate this with the "send" methods provided by the GridSimCore class. The
lack of ID information in the event raises an exception in the GridResource
class. Reading the source code of the GridResource class I've realized that the
way to send the ID of the sender could be the following:

super.send(resourceId, GridSimTags.SCHEDULE_NOW,
GridSimTags.RESOURCE_CHARACTERISTICS, new Integer(this.get_id()));

This solves the first problem but generates a new exception in other class:
Exception in thread "Thread-7" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -1
       at java.util.ArrayList.get(ArrayList.java:323)
       at eduni.simjava.Sim_system.send(Sim_system.java:600)
       at eduni.simjava.Sim_entity.sim_schedule(Sim_entity.java:342)
       at gridsim.net.Output.defaultSend(Unknown Source)
       at gridsim.net.Output.body(Unknown Source)
       at eduni.simjava.Sim_entity.run(Sim_entity.java:603)

I've read the source of the Output class, but I've not found a solution to the
problem. Do you know where can be the problem?

A: The problem was in the "baudRate" attribute that wasn't initialized.
So using GridSim(String name, double baudRate) the problem was solved.
